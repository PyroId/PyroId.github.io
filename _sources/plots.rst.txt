Plotting with plot_pyro
=======================
Pyropython contains a rudimentary plotting tool to quickly inspect the
experimental data, simulation results and goodness of fit. If you installed
the package using **pip**, you can get the plots by typing

::

    plot_pyro config.yml

The plots are defined in the **config.yml** file under the **plots** keyword.


.. code-block:: yaml

    plots:
        plotname: {variables:
                   labels:
                   type: "experimental"
                  ylabel:
                  xlabel:
                  }
